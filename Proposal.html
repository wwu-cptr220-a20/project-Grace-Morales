        <h1>Topic Overview</h1>
        <p>For my project I propose a website created to advertise and sell my art pieces and photography.
            In addition I would like the website to also include a space to share explanations of my art and
            photography process, and tips for amateur artists and photographers. So this website would educational
            for beginners, as well as showcase the work that results from what I would be discussing with said
            beginners.</p>
        <p>I want my website to be structured this way so that I can simultaneously sell the work I'm proud of and
            help others who want to learn. It's a good way for customers to fully appreciate the product they're
            buying. It also provides the opportunity for engagement for those that want to try to develop new
            artistic skill sets.</p>
        <p>It's difficult to find easily accessbile sources that discuss common beginner mistakes in art and
            photography and useful tips to fix those mistakes. There are plenty people that teach courses and
            classes that require payment and registration, but my website will be accessible and also provde results
            for what I discuss.</p>

        <h1>Potential Applications</h1>
        <dl>
            <dt>Art Transfer App
            <dd>This app would be particularly useful for amateurs who would want to transition to digital art whether
                as a main medium or to better edit their art. This would be an app that could use a scanning device or
                just take a picture of the art and turn it into a digital file.
                An app that can make these <a href="https://ashley-tsaishengchang.com/digitize-drawings-iphone/">listed steps</a> more efficient.</dd>
            </dt>

            <dt>Photo Perspective App
            <dd>This app will help users understand perspective. Simply take a picture of your subject, whether it's
                just a landscape or of a person. The app will then show several picture options of optimal
                perspectives the picture can be edited to look like.
                Similar to the <a

            </dt>

            <dt>Lighting Editing App
            <dd>Lighting is a big part of photography, and frankly my favorite thing to play with besides perspective.
                Any budding photographer will know how essential lighting and editing lighting can be for photos. This
                app would be primarily for fixing lighting and changing the lighting for the most optimal photos to
                really set their mood. Similar to what I primarily use for lighting: <a
