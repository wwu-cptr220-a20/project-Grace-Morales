            <h2>Art Forum</h2>
            <p>This art forum is dedicated to documenting and discussing my art processes. I create art in the form of
                paintings and photography, but I'm still an amateur and would like to show my journey and provide
                anything I
                learn to other beginners and amateurs looking for information.</p>
            <p>The Art Forum will be updated regularly to document any art pieces I am currently working on. The
                paintings
                will follow collection of materials, to linework and painting, all through to the finished project.
                Photographs will follow a different process. This process will showcase brainstorming photoshoot ideas,
                to
                gathering of props and models, to actual photoshoots, and finally to editing processes and printing.
            </p>
            <p>Such updates will include pictures and videos of these stages until a final product has been completed,
                then
                the product will be made available to purchase in the shop tab.</p>

                    <p>These photos were taken around Forks, Washington and the beach photos were at La Push Beach.
                        There
                        was no specific inspiration for a photoshoot, I had just wanted to take a lot of pictures of the
                        surrounding nature of the area. I did, however, want to focus specifically on aperture. This is
                        when
                        you can control how much light enters the camera, and this affects how sharp the foreground and
                        background
                        of your photos will look. You'll see that the close up photos focus on the main subject of the
                        photo
                        and the backgrounds are blurred to ensure the focus on the subject in the foreground. The beach
                        photo on the far right focuses on the subjects in the background, so the foreground and
                        background
                        have the same focus. </p>

                    <p>Question: Where do you buy your art supplies?</p>
                    <p>Answer: My art supplies come from either Michael's or Hobby Lobby. I prefer Michael's because
                        they
                        tend
                        to have more sales on the art supplies I use up more often.</p>

                    <p>Question: Where do you do your photoshoots?</p>
                    <p>Answer: My planned photoshoot locations tend to be opportunistic, most times they take place
                        either
                        at
                        local parks, or the venue I happen to be at. Otherwise photoshoots take place in people's
                        backyards.
